## Future-Development
  To continue to develop this application I plan to do the following:
* Fix the delete bug - When deleting a movie from your list, it causes the page to crash and need to be reloaded. I plan to fix this problem so it only re-renders within React
* Add Genres/Search by Genre - The genre is is currently accessible in the card, but I haven't linked the genres to their genre ids, I plan to accomplish that in future development, and also allow for a search function by genre, so that users can find new movies they want to see.
  
## Installation
  To download my app, all you have to do is grab the necessary files from my repository and run 'npm install' three times: once in the project folder, once in the client folder, and finally in the server folder. Then you have all you need to continue adding functionality to this app. Otherwise, this app can be viewed at https://mymdbexample.herokuapp.com/
  
## Usage
  To use this app, all you need to do is go into the file with Git Bash and run 'npm run develop' to start the server and the client directory, then you can test the functionality locally.
If you want to experience the deployed app, it is deployed at https://mymdbexample.herokuapp.com/.
